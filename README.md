## Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks related to fraud detection, data streaming, and real-time data visualization. These notebooks cover various aspects of processing, analyzing, and modeling data to address fraudulent transactions in eCommerce and other contexts.

## Files

1. **Analysing Fraudulent Transaction Data.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of fraudulent transaction datasets.
   - Key Components:
     - Analyzing patterns in fraudulent transactions.
     - Visualizing data distributions and key features.
     - Libraries used: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

2. **Building Models for eCommerce Fraud Detection.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Building and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection.
   - Key Components:
     - Preprocessing data for model training.
     - Training and evaluating models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
     - Libraries used: `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`.

3. **Producing the Data.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Simulating and producing data streams for analysis.
   - Key Components:
     - Generating mock data for fraud scenarios.
     - Producing data using streaming technologies.
     - Libraries used: `faker`, `pandas`.

4. **Consuming Data Using Kafka and Visualise.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Consuming data streams and visualizing results.
   - Key Components:
     - Setting up Kafka consumers to read data streams.
     - Visualizing the processed data for insights.
     - Libraries used: `kafka-python`, `matplotlib`.

5. **Streaming Application Using Spark Structured Streaming.ipynb**
   - Purpose: Building a streaming application for real-time data processing.
   - Key Components:
     - Setting up Spark Structured Streaming.
     - Processing streaming data in real-time.
     - Libraries used: `pyspark`.
