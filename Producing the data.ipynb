    "# 1. Producing the data\n",
    "In this task, we will implement Apache Kafka producers to simulate real-time data streaming. Spark is not allowed in this part since it’s simulating a streaming data source.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tYour program should send one batch of browsing behaviour data every 5 seconds. One batch consists of a random 500-1000 rows from the browsing behaviour dataset. The CSV shouldn’t be loaded to memory at once to conserve memory (i.e. Read row as needed). Keep track of the start and end event_time. (You can assume the dataset is sorted by event_time.)  \n",
    "2.\tAdd an integer column named ‘ts’ for each row, a Unix timestamp in seconds since the epoch. Spead your batch out evenly for 5 seconds.  \n",
    "a.\tFor example, if you send a batch of 600 records at 2023-09-01 00:00:00 (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) -> (ts = 1693526400):  \n",
    "-\tRecord 1-120: ts = 1693526400   \n",
    "-\tRecord 121-240: ts = 1693526401   \n",
    "-\tRecord 241-360: ts = 1693526402  \n",
    "-\t….  \n",
    "3.\tRead the transactions between the start and end event_time in 1.1 every 5 seconds (the same frequency as browsing behaviour) and create a batch.  \n",
    "4.\tSend your two batches from 1.1 and 1.3 to Kafka topics with an appropriate name.  \n",
    "Note 1: In 1.1, “random 500-1000” means the number of rows is random, and the data file is still read sequentially.  \n",
    "Note 2: All the data except for the ‘ts’ column should be sent in the original String type without changing to any other type. This is because we are simulating a streaming access log and need to reduce the required processing at the source.\n"
